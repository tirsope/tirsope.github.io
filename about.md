Electronic Engineer with expertise in Web development and Education. Education is part of the human being and it is a process that never ends. We never stop learning and solving problems with what we learnt and that is why I am so passionate about it, trying to find new ways to do things, always evolving and for that reason I love Web development, because it gives me the opportunity to solve problems in different ways and it helps me to improve my skills. Today is a good day to learn.
