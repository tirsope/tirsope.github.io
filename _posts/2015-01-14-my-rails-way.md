title: My Rails Way

Recently I bought the book: [Agile Web Development with Rails 4](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Development-Rails-Facets-Ruby/dp/1937785564/), so I've decided (officially) to get started my journey to learn Ruby on Rails, for that I created a github repository named [My Rails Way](https://github.com/tirsope/my-rails-way), in which I will track my achievements.

This is how the book's cover looks like:
