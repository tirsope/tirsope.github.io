title: RSpec The Right Way
---

I've started a subscription with [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com), which I recommend, [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com) has a large library of videos, so I've been using it for a few days and it looks great so far.

I'm taking the course called "RSpec The Right Way". This course is a great way to begin with Behavior Driven Development (BDD) usign RSpec and Rails.

The course was released in 2012, so some methods of RSpec have changed and I had to adapt the code to the new ones, I just made a few changes and all the tests are passing.

Here's the Github [repository](https://github.com/tirsope/rspec-right-way) in case you want to take a look.
