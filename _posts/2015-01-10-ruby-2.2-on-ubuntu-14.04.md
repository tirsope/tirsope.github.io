title: Ruby 2.2.0 on Ubuntu 14.04
---

I've installed Ruby 2.2.0 on Ubuntu 14.04, but I encountered a problem with a dependency, so I would like to share how I finally got it running!.

These are the steps I followed:

1. First, download Ruby 2.2.0 from [Ruby language official page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/es/downloads/). You can use ```curl``` or ```wget``` to download the file from the console, use the one you feel more confortable with.


	```
	curl -O http://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.2/ruby-2.2.0.tar.gz
	```

	or

	```
	wget http://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.2/ruby-2.2.0.tar.gz
	```
2. Decompress the downloaded file:

	```
	tar -xvzf ruby-2.2.0.tar.gz
	```

3. Go to ruby-2.2.0 folder. You can use " ```cd ruby-2.2.0``` " without the quotes.

4. Install the required dependencies. Type or copy the following line and hit enter, you will be asked for root password:
	
	```
		sudo apt-get install autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline6-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm3 libgdbm-dev
	```
5. If everything goes right, run the following lines, one at a time:

	```
	./configure
	```

	```
	make
	```

	```
	sudo make install
	```

6. Check if ruby was installed.

	```
	ruby -v
	```

	This should give us the version of ruby, in this case 2.2.0.

7. And you're set, this would install ruby on your Ubuntu machine or VPS 

PS: If you have any problem building ruby on Ubuntu, I recommend you read this [page](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/wiki) on GitHub, which give us the most common problems you can face installing ruby, not just on Ubuntu, but on other platforms.
